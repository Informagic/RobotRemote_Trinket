# RobotRemote_Trinket
A re-purposed Saitek X6-33M gamepad to serve as remote control and status feedback for another robot project. The MIDI interface was decoded, the cable cut, a 5V Adafruit Trinket Pro added in one of the handles, connected to an XBee module, a battery holder for 4 1.5 V AA cells was added, and an Adafruit 16x2 color change display will be incorporated.
